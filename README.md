## Predicting Fire Brigade Notional Price

London Fire Brigade is forced to allocate a large number of fire-fighters as well as pumps around London on a daily basis. This is a time-consuming process for the LFB1, as well as a real grapple for fire-fighters.

In this project, we focused on working with the LFB's large dataset to understand what features might influence the price of such service and how the notional price could be predicted using a machine learning method that works best with our dataset.

We first began by cleaning the dataset. This process, involved removing some unnecessary records as well as selecting the most impactful features. 

We then applied some regression methods such as, Linear regression, svm, lasso, ridge and k-nearest neighbors to predict the price of fire brigade service.

Since the data pattern is linear, we noticed that, linear regressors are the most accurate predictors and they outperform other regressors. Therefore, the top three recommended methods are linear regression, svm and ridge regression respectively. 

We discovered a number of ways that machine learning may increase awareness inside the organization and with a hope that it would help them make better decisions. It can be concluded that in such service, the number of hours in which the pump will be on directly determines the price. Although other features would impact the price, but Pump Hour Round Up will out shadow their effect.
