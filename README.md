# Machine Learning Project-Predicting Fire Brigade Notional Price

## Introduction

London Fire Brigade is forced to allocate a large number of fire-fighters as well as pumps around London on a daily basis. This is a time-consuming process for the LFB1, as well as a real grapple for fire-fighters.

In this project, we focused on working with the LFB's large dataset to understand how we could enhance this process with the help of machine learning. Our primary goal was to find the major elements that influence the cost of the fire events using a machine learning method that works best with our dataset. 

We discovered a number of ways that machine learning may increase awareness inside the organization and with a hope that it would help them make better decisions. In our project, the data analytics were performed in two ways: machine learning and statistical analysis. 

We first began by cleaning the dataset. This process, involved removing some unnecessary records as well as selecting the most impactful features. We then applied some regression methods for example, Linear regression, svm, lasso, ridge and k-nearest neighbors to predict the price of fire brigade service.

We noticed that as we initially expected, the linear regressors e.g. linear regression, svm and ridge outperform other regressors as data pattern is linear in the space we created with the final input features.
We concluded that the only elements that would determine the price of the service, is the amount of hours in which the pumps will remain on.
